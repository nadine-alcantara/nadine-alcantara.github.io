summary: My first violin arrangement for a violin-guitar duet using Musescore

[Musescore](https://musescore.org/en) is a music composition and notation software that helped me create my arrangement.

Joe Hisaishi's composition of _Merry Go Round of Life_ for the famouse Ghibli Movie _Howl's Moving Castle_ has always been my favorite piece of his. I have only heard traditional versions or "arrangements" online for orchestra or a string ensemble. However, I wanted to know how it would sound with violin and guitar, so I formed a duet with my friend to help me with this idea. One of the challenging aspects of this project was communication, where I needed to both listen and converse about who gets the melody in one phrase and where it shifts to the other voice. It shows on the score that measures with the moving notes are phrases where the violin has the melody, and measures with rests or phrases that are not the theme are the accompaniment parts. By arranging my own sheet music instead if searching for one online, it allowed me freedom to add my own flourishes and ideas. For example, I utilized the software's key change feature to raise the key "modulate" during the last half of the piece, and add harmony where I felt would fit with the guitar best.
