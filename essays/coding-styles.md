## intro
Having experience with coding for the past few years, there was always a standard that I, and many other programmers, have to adhere to. While it is easy to ignore, and quite frankly, more comfortable to dismiss, we always need to follow a certain template whenever we write our code. We programmers have the follow the guidelines of Coding Standards. On the surface, coding standards might be viewed as the one thing only nitpickers and perfectionists only care about. Making sure that each line is indented with proper amount of spaces, ensuring that the methods in a for-loop are enclosed with curly braces, or replacing the usage of `var` with `const` or `let` in JavaScript â€“ these are all the typical rules within the standards. Although it might seem humbug to follow, I see it as a tool for improving my skills as a software engineer. To visualize my understandings, let us compare the process of writing code to baking a cake.
