## intro
Having experience with coding for the past few years, there was always a standard that I, and many other programmers, have to adhere to. While it is easy to ignore, and quite frankly, more comfortable to dismiss, we always need to follow a certain template whenever we write our code. We programmers have the follow the guidelines of Coding Standards. On the surface, coding standards might be viewed as the one thing only nitpickers and perfectionists only care about. Making sure that each line is indented with proper amount of spaces, ensuring that the methods in a for-loop are enclosed with curly braces, or replacing the usage of `var` with `const` or `let` in JavaScript – these are all the typical rules within the standards. Although it might seem humbug to follow, I see it as a tool for improving my skills as a software engineer. To visualize my understandings, let us compare the process of writing code to baking a cake.

## what it is
I have never baked a cake in my life, mind you, but I for sure know what one looks like and what one is made of. Basically, a cake is no more than a simple, delicious structure made of sponge cake or any other base, decorated with appropriately matching icing. The sponge cake is usually layered with multiple tiers, covered all around with a moderate amount of icing. In some cakes, there may be additional layers of icing in between each layer of sponge for added presentation. Shifting the focus back to JavaScript, or coding in any language for that matter, I think that typing in the editor window is like backing and structuring my cake. I layer my “cake” with its necessary components like its classes, functions, objects, methods, variables, and so on. In the end, all of the layers come together to form a cohesive, working project or assignment.
