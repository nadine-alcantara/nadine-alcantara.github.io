## How I ended up in computer science
Design has always been a strong passion of mine. I come from a background that revolves around the arts as I enjoy my hobbies of drawing, painting, as well as playing the violin. Problem solving and puzzles are also a big interest for me. If I have free time to spare between classes, I usually pass the time solving Rubik's Cubes, doing Sudoku, or playing puzzle video games like _The Legend of Zelda._ The satisfaction of problem solving is mostly the reason why my favorite classes in high school were my STEM courses. luckily, during my senior year there, a new AP Computer Science course was formed, so I took the opportunity to expose myself to this new field of learning computer coding, with Java being by first language.

## First impressions of Javascript
As Java was my primary programming language, learning Javascript feels like a breath of fresh air. Although both languages have very similar syntax styles, Javascript allows more freedom, such as specifying every variable type with `let` or `const` instead of constricting them to a singular `int`, `string`, etc. With a more simpler environment, Javascript feels like a good programming language from a software engineering perspective.

## "WOD" is it like?
I have never heard of "athletic software engineering" before I started ICS 314. When I found out that such exercise implementations for the course would be WODS, I was anxious because of the pressure for coding under a time limit. I prefer to take my time while problem solving; rushing myself usually results in overlooked errors, woven in my really clumsy work. However, I believe that allowing myself to succeed in WODs would help improve fluency in Javascript, or any language in that matter, as training myself to code faster for the solution also trains me to be more of a productive thinker and avoid convoluted answers. Saves me time and energy!

## Takeaways
It would take some time before all this fast-pace learning settles itself into my own pace of learning. Looking ahead,
