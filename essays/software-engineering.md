I had my first taste of learning computer coding when I was a senior in high school. At the moment, my pathway for my future studies was still uncertain, but I knew I wanted to commit to a career in the STEM field. Throughout high school, I persisted to excel in the numerous math and science that were available to me where during my senior, a new AP computer science course opened. It was completely new yet intriguing to me; my thoughts began to dance in my head, wondering if I would get to learn the ins-and-outs of a computer’s brain. Designing websites, developing video games, inventing new aspects of AI technology – I associated all of them with computer science, so I mustered up all my courage to enroll for the class, diving unknowingly into a new and exciting experience.

Little did I know, the flourishes that surrounded the idea of computer science were all mere fantasies in my head. The young, naïve student I was had not realized that developing such fascinating technology required me to learn the logic behind its 1’s and 0’s. It frustrated me when creating a simple text-based Hangman game needed an abundant amount of methods and objects, along with all of the excruciating hours I put just staring at errors in my code. Albeit, Java is certainly not the most user-friendly language out there for a beginner like me to start with, but its intricacies drove me to push myself even harder to learn the concept of programming languages in general. I knew that from the moment I stepped through those classroom doors that this would not be an easy journey for me, but this serves as a great test of diligence and strength for me to find my long-awaited passion

To me, software engineering is a vehicle that allows me to pursue many paths that I wish to take on. I am still undecided where I want to take this vehicle, but I am looking to take the road towards software development or web design. Perhaps, it would be fun combining my drive for technology with my love for art. Designing has always stuck as my passion since I was a kid, doodling in class and enjoying creating art that stemmed from my creativity. Now with this new tool under my belt, I might be able to use my knowledge of software development to hone my creativity even further. Someday, it would be an accomplishment to design my own website or small indie game layout and see my creations come to life.

So far, with my elementary skillset of Java and self-taught acquaintance with markdown and HTML, achieving my dreams at this moment would be incredibly difficult. There is still a lot more to learn and a larger world to discover. However, through an incredible amount of grit and perseverance to master these languages, or at least pass the associated classes, I would be equipped with the right tools to accomplish my future endeavors. Not only do I wish to become a better programmer, but I hope to strive to become a better learner, one who absorbs great knowledge and uses them towards greater feats.
