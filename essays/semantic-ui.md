Before working with UI Frameworks, I already have had experience with HTML and dabbled with CSS. This markup language came easy to me, as the language for defining and styling elements were very straight forward. Though, such a simple framework may only be suitable for reading, not so much for design and looking elegant. With the help of Semantic UI, we were able to effortlessly create pages that also look visually appealing.

Semantic UI is a unique framework that implements the use of natural English language to link concepts in HTML. For example, if I want to include a large, red button on my site, I would simply add 
```html
<button class="ui large red button"></button>
``` 
As simple as that, Semantic UI will automatically format an element with such keywords without the hassle of styling it in CSS. Along with the many other adjectives to go with other pre-existing elements, the possibilities of web designing are endless. However, there is a challenge when it comes to learning a new framework and that is knowing what possibilities are available to me.
